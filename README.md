# flask-app
User stuff

This is a basic user interface that allows users to create accounts and login. As of right now it has no nice formatting or really much of anything, but it is going to be where the full NYUCTIP application will soon be running. As of now it allows you to save places.

If you would like to see the application running it is available at: https://nyuctip.azurewebsites.net/

To setup: run pip install -r requirements.txt

After this look at the variables in config.cfg and create environment variables for them.

The master branch is a local version of the code, the deploy branch is one that has specifically been configured to deploy on an azure webserver.

The application should then be ready to deploy.
