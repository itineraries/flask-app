# Flask App
This is the full NYU CTIP application web application.

If you would like to see the application running, it is available at: https://www.nyuctip.com/

To setup: run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

After this look at the variables in [config.cfg](config.cfg) and create environment variables for them.

The application should then be ready to deploy.

The `master` branch is a local version of the code; the `app-for-deployment` branch is one that has specifically been configured to deploy on an Azure web app.
